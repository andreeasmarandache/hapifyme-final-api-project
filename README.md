# HapifyMe API Automation Project 🧪

A Java-based **API automation project** demonstrating a **complete End-to-End user lifecycle** for the HapifyMe application.

---

## 🌟 Overview

This project is part of my portfolio and showcases my skills in:

- API automation with **Rest-Assured** and **TestNG**  
- Dynamic data handling using **JavaFaker**  
- JSON serialization/deserialization with **Jackson**  
- Asynchronous polling and response waiting using **Awaitility**  
- Organizing a **Maven project** with clear package structure (`models`, `utils`, `tests`)

The project covers the **full user lifecycle**:

1. Registration with dynamically generated data  
2. Email confirmation  
3. Login and obtaining Bearer token  
4. Profile retrieval and validation  
5. Profile update  
6. User deletion and verification
